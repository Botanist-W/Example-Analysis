# Example-Analysis from masters thesis

## Summary 
My MRes project investigated how conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD)—where species-specific natural enemies reduce offspring survival near parent trees—affects tropical tree diversity in fragmented landscapes. Using an individual-based simulation in continuous space, I explored the effects of habitat fragmentation, immigration, and network topology on community-level diversity. Building on theoretical and empirical studies, the project tested whether CNDD can maintain biodiversity under realistic disturbance scenarios. Results highlight that CNDD’s stabilising effects are highly sensitive to fragment size and connectivity, 



The simulation models tree communities across multiple fragments with local recruitment and immigration. Competition is modelled via a spatially explicit neighbourhood competition index. Simulations vary levels of CNDD, Heterospecific NDD, immigration rates, fragmentation level, and network topology on diversity and spatial patterns. Analyses include species abundances, Shannon diversity, and spatial statistics (Clark-Evans and pair correlation functions), comparing outcomes to a dispersal-limited null model and real forest data.

Here I have included the first step of the analysis aiming to create a baseline for how CNDD acts in the large continuous forest, which is later used for comparison to following simulations and real world data.
